      Hi, my name is Frank. I am discreet and don't necessarily like to share
      information about myself publicly. However, I would be happy to discuss
      with you about anything. If you want to ask a question about an article,
      leave a comment. I always answer. 
      <br/> I like learning programming languages, I wrote Julia, Python, Ocaml..., and I like AI.
      <br />I am looking for remote internship, if you want to contact me
      send an email to <a href="mailto:frankwaang@outlook.com">
