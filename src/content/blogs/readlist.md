## Updated 2023/5/10
I've been up to `Ocaml` or more generally Functional Programming for a while. Been captured by the simplicity of functional expression and beautiful pattern matching style. However, the lack of study materials in various forms as well as the notorious lack of documentations discourage me a lot, I want to share some materials I think is usful here to help me catch up with FP better(this table would be updated frequently): 


| clickable title | content | level | 
| --------------- | ------- | ----- |
| [Real Word Ocaml](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/index.html) | Useful, Real-world example of Ocaml | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| [OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/ds/memoization.html) | Intro Level FP course | ⭐ | 
| [CS3110: 15SP](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2015sp/recitations/9/rec09.html) | Previous material of the second one, very useful | ⭐⭐ | 


I like *Real World Ocaml* very much and strongly recommend this one if you got interest in `Ocaml` and already have some programming experience, I've finish first 8 chapters and stucked at the 9th chapter. And overall, my feeling of the examples given in the book is that easy ones are easy and make natural sense to me but some examples like the ones given in [GADTs](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/gadts.html) are hard to follow as polymorphic type have not been discussed at this chapter. I would write an article on my learnings of `OCaml` and stop here to talk about other resources.
