## Hey ! 👋

Hello, my name is **Frank** and I'm a grad student in Financial Engineering at UIUC. <br>
I'm not sure how my website caught you eyeballs, but I'm glad you are here.

## Who am I ?

I'm a 22 years old grad student in Financial Engineering. I'm in loved with Functional Programming, spending spare time working side-projects built with Julia, Typescript and, of course, Python. 

## What is this blog about ?

This blog is about my journey in OSS, and my projects. <br>
I will try to write articles about what I'm learning, and what I'm doing. <br>
I will also try to write articles about my projects, how I made them and what motivate me do create them.

## How was this blog made ?

This blog is made with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a static site generator. <br>
I'm using [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) for the styling. <br>
And to host the website, I'm using GitHub🫡.
