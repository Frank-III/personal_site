I've been longing for talking about my PC, laptops so far, and here it comes!! So excited to share both the hardware and software I have been used that boost my productivity(at least it make me enjoy coding more)

## Intro of my setup

I got two laptops and one PC and below is the description of each:

| Name | Type | Description| Perf| OS|
| ------| ------| -----------|-----| ---| 
| Lenovo 16inch| LapTop | 32G Ram/AMD CPU/Nadia 30x GPU |Powerful/ Battery-draining | KDE Neon / Windows 11 Dual Boot|
| Apple 16inch MBP | LapTop | 32G Ram/ M2 Pro/ 1TB | Long Lasting/Coder Friendly| MacOS |
| DIY PC| PC | 64G Ram / i7-13700K/RTX6800xt/ 2TB| Super powerful | Hackintosh / Arch Linux Dual Boot|

As you can see, the setup is really not for Gaming AT ALL, I enjoy the software environment in MacOS and that is why I dual boot my Monster with Hackintosh instead of Windows (a lot of trade-off here: not option for more powerful AMD CPUs and Nvdia GPUs). You may ask why I even need Arch or whatever Linux distro, the reason is installers like Yay make installing softwares a pleasure and I could not dealing with buggy ROMc`(the AMD GPU Driver that hopeful could do some ML training work)`, also, the new Hyprland windows compositor is appealing for people not get familiar with tilling windows managers like i3, dwm...etc but want to give a try.
